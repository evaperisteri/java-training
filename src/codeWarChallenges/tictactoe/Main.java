/**
 * If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the
 * board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a
 * function that will check that for us!
 *
 * Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array,
 * where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X",
 * or 2 if it is an "O", like so:
 *
 * [[0, 0, 1],
 *  [0, 1, 2],
 *  [2, 1, 0]]
 * We want our function to return:
 *
 * -1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
 * 1 if "X" won,
 * 2 if "O" won,
 * 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
 * You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
